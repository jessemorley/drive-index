# To Do

## Features

### High

- ~~Finish hotkey implementation~~
- Increase search results window size/height
- ~~Add capacity bar to offline drives; remove "% full"~~
- Window size for 1 drive incorrect
- ~~Change exclusion text to chips~~
- ~~Remove buttons don't work~~
- No re-indexing feedback in settings
- Only show connected drives in menu bar
- Add eject button for connected drives (menu and settings)
- Add quit button

### Medium

- Keyboard navigation. (Pressing down from search highlights first result. Can move through and press enter to open in finder. Maybe an indication of what the action is going to be?)
- Settings window appears on top
- Last scanned only updates when menu bar is open

### Low

- Custom menubar icon
- Custom app icon
- Drive exclusion (maybe an inital prompt/dialog asking if you'd like to sync or ignore that drive)
- Automatic drive sync (FSEvents)

### Stretch

- Browse drives/file tree interface
- Implement Sparkle updates
- Cloud sync with CloudKit

## Bugs

- Database location button sizing
