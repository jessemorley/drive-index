# To Do

## Features

### High

- Increase search results window size/height
- Add eject button to menubar window
- Add quit button

### Medium

- [ ] Keyboard navigation. (Pressing down from search highlights first result. Can move through and press enter to open in finder. Maybe an indication of what the action is going to be?)
- [ ]Settings window appears on top
- [ ] MacOS-style storage use summary

### Low

- Custom menubar icon
- Custom app icon
- Drive exclusion (maybe an inital prompt/dialog asking if you'd like to sync or ignore that drive)
- Automatic drive sync (FSEvents)

### Stretch

- Browse drives/file tree interface
- Implement Sparkle updates
- Cloud sync with CloudKit

## Bugs

- [ ] Database location button sizing
- [ ] Last scanned only updates when menu bar is open
- [x] Drive window height doesn't match precisely
- [x] Popup occassionally doesn't appear where last moved to
- [ ] Exclusions alphabetised on save
