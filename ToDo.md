# To Do

## Features

### High

- [ ] Add eject button to menubar window
- [ ] Scan button always says "Rescan"
- [ ] FSEvents monitoring for indexing after file changes
- [x] Drive exclusion (maybe an inital prompt/dialog asking if you'd like to sync or ignore that drive)
- [ ] Phase 3: Directory Modification Caching (Advanced Optimization)
- [ ] Excluded and un-indexed drives show under Indexed Drives
    - Green for connected and indexed
    - Grey for connected and unindexed
    - Grey for not connected and unindexed


### Medium

- [ ] Keyboard navigation. (Pressing down from search highlights first result. Can move through and press enter to open in finder. Maybe an indication of what the action is going to be?)
- [ ] Settings window appears on top
- [ ] MacOS-style storage use summary
